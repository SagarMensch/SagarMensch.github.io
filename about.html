    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

    <p class="intro-text">
      I came from the future. A place where data flows faster than light, where thoughts are currency, and where the line 
      between man and machine is beautifully blurred. I built <strong>THOUGHTS.CO</strong> not just to write — but to 
      disrupt, to spark, to question. Here, you’ll find insights crafted at the intersection of artificial intelligence, 
      human emotion, and timeless curiosity.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      Whether you're here for the latest on AI, to decode financial markets, or to explore the strategies that will shape 
      tomorrow’s businesses — you’re in the right place. Because the future isn’t coming. It’s already here.
